# Professional README Generator

## Purpose

* Quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

* A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

* This includes everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain. 

* The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```
